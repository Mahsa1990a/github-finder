# Github Finder

Deployed React app to search GitHub profiles.
Without using Redux, Third parties and state! I implemented app leve state using the context API with userReducer, useContext hooks for state management along with useState and useEffect.
I started off this project using class based components and stateless functional components and then refactored it into all functional components. First I used Third party API(GitHub API) then update it with Context API!
